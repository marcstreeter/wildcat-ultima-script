# wildcat-ultima-script

We don't have the original, but We have some attempts
- [first-attempt] - pretty close to the original script
- [second-attempt] - the game doesn't require you to cancel the spell
- [third-attempt] - the best timing (wasn't overwriting any spells), wanted to change is that we dno't it to cast cure and archcure but I just want it to cast recure off the bat
